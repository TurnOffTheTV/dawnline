# Contributing

You clicked on this file. That makes it seem like you want to contribute. That's great! Here are some guidelines:

## Development

Make all changes on the development branch. When I've decided there's enough new stuff for a new major release, I'll push it onto the main branch (and thus website)

When writing code, try to follow the style. Maybe you think it's weird, but it's how I write JavaScript. Also, make sure to comment. You don't need a comment on every line, but each block should be explained.

## Writing Documentation

There's not a lot to this app at this point, but eventually there will be, and we're going to need some documentation for all the features.

## Testing

You can test the [development version](dev.dawnline.turnoffthetv.xyz) or the [main version](dawnline.turnoffthetv.xyz). If you find any issues, add them to... well, the Issues tab.

## Ideas

If you just want to give me an idea you've had, you can also go to the Issues tab, just make sure to mark it as a suggestion rather than a bug.
